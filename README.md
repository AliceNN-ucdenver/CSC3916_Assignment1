# Assignment One
## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to setup your GitHub and Heroku (or Rendor) instances for future assignments

You will create a Postman collection and create a REST test within the project. You will need to automate each test and include at least 1 assert for each request in the validation.

## Requirements
- Sign-up for a free GitHub account: https://github.com/ – Homework assignments will be stored on GitHub.
- Create an ECHO server (from lecture) 
- Setup Heroku (or Rendor) to autodeploy your application from your REPO CSC3916_HW1
- Create a PostMan request that posts a body value to your API 
    - Create an environment variable $echo_body for the body of the request
    - Asserts (test) must include
        - Validating string sent is what is returned  (use $echo_body to validate against the response sent back from the server)
        - Response status code (e.g. 200)
        - Response time < 200ms

## Submissions
- All source code should be stored on github (remember .gitignore for node_modules)
- API needs to be deployed to heroku
- Create a readme.md at the root of your github repository with the embedded (markdown) to your test collection
    - Within the collection click the (…), share collection -> Embed
    - Static Button
    - Click update link
    - Include your environment settings
    - Copy to clipboard 
- Submit the Url to canvas with the REPO CSC_3916
